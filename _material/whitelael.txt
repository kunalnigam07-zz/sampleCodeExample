Hi Tony,


Below are notes from my discussion with Darren in regards to the white label solution:


The white label will be similar to what we did with ASG: many URLs to access the same system, and based on the URL serve specific content.
 
The system will allow you to add multiple "skin" options in the CMS which consists primarily of a CSS file (for colours), logo, domain name and content for pages like About, email templates, etc.
 
For example, if you add one for Virgin Active, we will create a red skin CSS and you'll add it along with other content in the CMS. When a person uses the domain (say www.virginlive.co.uk) it points to your system and the system then detects the domain and serves the appropriate content, CSS, etc.
 
So basically the same system, skinned based on the URL accessing it.
 
We would need to cater for this from a HTML and development perspective. For HTML we need Tomasz or Konrad to have a separate CSS file for colours, one we can duplicate and change for future skins. Development wise Darren needs to enable management of these extra "systems" along with content-specific items like content pages, email templates, etc.



Time to implement this:


HTML 1 day.
 
Development 2 weeks.


Note: it would be extremely time consuming to reverse engineer this feature once the site has gone live.


Let me know what you want to do with this and the bulk purchasing as we need to factor these in if they are going ahead.


Kind regards,


Neil.
